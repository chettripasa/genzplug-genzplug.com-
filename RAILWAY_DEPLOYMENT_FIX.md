# Railway Socket.IO Server Deployment Fix

## Current Issue
Socket.IO is timing out when trying to connect to `https://genzplug-socket.railway.app` because:
1. The Socket.IO endpoint (`/socket.io/`) is not accessible (404 error)
2. CORS is only allowing `https://railway.com` origin
3. The Railway server might not be properly deployed

## Immediate Fix Required

### Step 1: Check Railway Deployment Status
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app)
2. Find your `genzplug-socket` project
3. Check if it's running and deployed
4. Look at the deployment logs for any errors

### Step 2: Verify Railway Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
PORT=3001
HOST=0.0.0.0
NODE_ENV=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://genzplug.com,https://genzplug.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Redeploy Railway Server
1. **Trigger a new deployment** in Railway
2. **Check the logs** for any startup errors
3. **Verify the server starts** with the correct configuration

### Step 4: Test Railway Server
After redeployment, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://genzplug-socket.railway.app/health

# Test Socket.IO endpoint (should return HTML, not 404)
curl https://genzplug-socket.railway.app/socket.io/

# Test with proper headers
curl -H "Origin: https://genzplug.com" https://genzplug-socket.railway.app/health
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### Health Endpoint Should Return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-06T07:44:53.717Z",
  "service": "socket-server",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "memory": {...},
  "connections": 0
}
```

### Socket.IO Endpoint Should Return:
- HTML page with Socket.IO client library (not 404)
- Proper CORS headers allowing genzplug.com

### CORS Headers Should Include:
```
access-control-allow-origin: https://genzplug.com
access-control-allow-credentials: true
```

## Alternative: Quick Test Without Railway

If Railway continues to have issues, you can temporarily test with a different approach:

### Option 1: Use Socket.IO CDN
Update the Socket.IO client to use CDN instead of self-hosted:

```javascript
// In socket-client.tsx, temporarily disable socket connection
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  console.warn('Socket.IO temporarily disabled - Railway server not accessible');
  return null;
}
```

### Option 2: Use Different Hosting Service
Consider deploying Socket.IO server to:
- **Vercel** (as serverless functions)
- **Heroku** (free tier available)
- **Render** (free tier available)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**

## Debugging Commands

### Check Railway Logs:
```bash
railway logs --project genzplug-socket
```

### Test Socket.IO Connection:
```javascript
// Run in browser console on genzplug.com
const socket = io('https://genzplug-socket.railway.app', {
  transports: ['polling', 'websocket'],
  timeout: 10000
});

socket.on('connect', () => console.log('✅ Connected!'));
socket.on('connect_error', (err) => console.error('❌ Error:', err));
socket.on('disconnect', (reason) => console.log('Disconnected:', reason));
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check Railway deployment status**
2. **Verify environment variables**
3. **Redeploy if necessary**
4. **Test all endpoints**
5. **Monitor Socket.IO connection**

The timeout error indicates the Railway server is not properly configured or deployed. Once fixed, Socket.IO should connect successfully.
